## Overview

The first principle of our Office of Design & Delivery is to [Put Residents First](http://odd.austintexas.io/how-we-work/), which means connecting with our community about their needs and expectations, and testing and refining solutions with residents. This role is fundamental for delivering on this vision as we grow. The ideal candidate is able to manage communication and logistics for recruiting and scheduling interviews, collecting notes, photos, and video during sessions, organizing and sharing resources after each round of research, and developing documentation for repeatable practices that we can share across projects, departments, and other cities.

Note that existing experience with field research is not required. We’re looking for someone with the right mix of skills around communication, logistics, and documentation who can support our teams as we grow, which makes this a great opportunity for anyone interested in starting a career in service design or user research.

Our teams are working to improve a wide range of city services, including researching and redesigning our [permitting processes](http://permittingatx.com/), prototyping ways to change behaviors around [recycling and composting](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/vision-zero-waste/about/overview/), designing the future of [austin.gov](http://alpha.austin.gov/), and creating city-wide standards for service design, web development, and user research.
